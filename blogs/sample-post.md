# Welcome to the Blog!

This is the content of my first sample blog post. It's written in Markdown.

Here are some features you can use:

*   **Bold text** and *italic text*.
*   Lists, like this one.
*   Code blocks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
}

greet('World');
```

You can add more posts by creating new `.md` files in the `blogs` directory, following the same frontmatter structure.
