        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi, I'm Sudarshan, a final-year undergraduate in Computer Science and Engineering at the Manipal Institute of Technology
            in India.  I have a wide range of interests, and hope to use this website as a window into my life.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I also plan to write all the code for this website myself, learning a bit of web development during the process. 
        </p>
        <ul>
           <li>I'm broadly interested in the areas of Natural Language Processing and computational social science, wherein my primary motivation is to use NLP tools to better understand social science data</li> 
           <li>I currently work as a Machine Learning Intern at <a href = "https://clearfeed.ai/">Clearfeed</a>, where my work involves using Natural Language Processing to help Customer Support teams serve their clients better</li>
           <li>I previously worked as a research intern at the <a href = "https://www.trusthlt.org/">TrustHLT Lab</a> in TU Darmstadt, under the supervision of <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ERp8VTsAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao">Dr. Ivan Habernal</a>. I spent a wonderful summer in Germany as a DAAD-WISE Scholar during the internship, during which I worked on research in privacy-preserving NLP </li>
           <li>I also read regularly on a wide range of topics including politics, history, and literature. To see what I'm reading right now and what I have read previously, follow me on <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/127463955-sudarshan-sivakumar">Goodreads</a></li>      
           <li>I love playing and watching tennis, having once been a state-level tennis player, and the captain of my college tennis team. This means I spend some of my weekends screaming at the TV during Rafael Nadal's matches, and a lot of my evenings screaming at myself on court.</li>          
        </ul>
