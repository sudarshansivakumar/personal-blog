        <p>
            This is my tiny attempt at writing about things I find interesting. 
            Some of these will be technical, perhaps NLP/Computational Social Science related, etc. and ideally a lot of these will be non-technical
            â€” about my politics, what I found interesting recently, and what I am reading/watching.
